# SIG proposal

## What will be the name of the SIG?

Science Communication SIG.

## What is/will be the SIG's motto?

Unleash the storyteller in you (preliminary).

## Who will act as SIG Lead?

- Pablo Rodríguez-Sánchez.
- Lieke de Boer will also be involved in chairing the sessions.

## What is the SIG's mission?

We want to promote science communication and outreach inside our
organization. 

This aligns well with our institutional targets. It also aligns with the engineers' interests: we conducted a
survey that showed that, out of 39 votes, the interest in
such a SIG was (high: 7, conditional: 25, null: 8).

## What is the GitHub repository of the SIG?

https://github.com/NLeSC/Scicomm-SIG

## What is the Office group that the SIG uses?

Team channel:  [`SIGs/Science communication SIG`](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a1d723c5475fe4f358b662beb9b499b54%40thread.tacv2/Science%2520communication%2520SIG?groupId=1d47d6e8-7246-4564-8160-7a8adcdd4c16&tenantId=aa3aeacc-6307-42b2-ac05-787dd5c32574)

## Plans for the next period

We aim for one session per month, starting in February 2023.
The SIG will have two types of basic sessions:

- **Writing together**: an hour blocked for working in that blog piece
    you have in mind. The most experienced bloggers can brainstorm and coach with you.

- **Seminars**: an expert, either internal or external, can prepare
    some materials about, say, public speaking, slides design or user
    experience. and present them to the group.

Additionally, every now and then we can **invite an external speaker**
that will delight us with a fascinating story (we already have a list of candidates).

Ideally, both types of sessions will be alternating.
But that will depend on speakers' availability.

## What are the expected outputs of the SIG?

Increase the visibility of the eScience Center to the outside world. More specifically:

- Increase the number and quality of eScience blogs.
- Increase the quality of our presentations, both internal and external.
- Increase awareness about what we do and what makes us unique.
- Invite engineers to talk to other audiences than researchers (journalists, policymakers, students, ...).

## Links to other activities

Our SIG has natural links with:

- **The blogging editorial team**: the idea of this SIG was born among the members of the blogging editorial team. We'll be colaborating closely to publish (most of) the outcomes of this SIG.
- **The four scientific sections**: every engineer is encouraged to do some communication about their projects (other topics are also welcome). We aim to create an enjoyable space for this to happen. Additionally, some projects involve the writing of manuals and storylines, for which we can also provide, at the very least, a brainstorming space.
- **UX - Web SIG**: better texts and storylines are a fundamental part of the user experience. Layouts and formats are part of the readers experience as well.
- **Visualization SIG**: visualization and storytelling are deeply related.
- **Soft skills SIG**: communication is one of the core soft skills, but it is broad and strategic enough to deserve its own specialized SIG.
