# Application form for starting/continuing a SIG

## What is/will be the name of the SIG?

Analytics and Numerical Analysis

## Which person will act as SIG Lead?

- Artur Palha: a.palha@esciencecenter.nl (1-1-2023 to 30-6-2023)
- Johan Hidding: j.hidding@esciencecenter.nl (1-7-2023 to 31-12-2023)

## What is SIG’s mission?

To contribute to the internal development of knowledge on applied mathematics topics, both analytical and numerical, at the Netherlands eScience Center. More specifically, the SIG aims to:

- Provide introductory talks on key topics in applied mathematics, with a focus on analytics and numerical analysis, _e.g._, time integrators, partial differential equations discretisations, linear algebra, statistics, analysis.
- Provide a link between applied theory and software package implementations.
- Provide a meeting point for members to bring their own applied math problem to be discussed.

## What is the GitHub repository of the SIG use?

## What is the Office group that the SIG uses?

- Outlook address: analytics@esciencecenter.nl
- Team channel: [link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aa11e3f83467d4865a8f6ec20ec2b01cf%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=fc37e009-9e3b-44bb-a013-aa5f1cd9cedb&tenantId=aa3aeacc-6307-42b2-ac05-787dd5c32574)

## SIG outcomes of the past year (for existing SIGs)

??????

## Plans for the coming year

### General organization of SIG

The SIG meets twice per month. The first session of the month is an open discussion session, where the participants can bring their own problems or request a topic to study/analyze.

### Open discussion sessions

Currently we have 6 open discussion sessions planned. The topics to address cannot be planned in advance. The participants will bring their own topics to address.

### Talk sessions

- **Causal inference for data-driven science**: [2nd of March] *Jakob Runge*, DLR, TU Berlin.
- **Flowmaps on map projections**: [20th of April] *Paulo Raposo*, University of Twente.
- **Geometric time integrators**: [25th of May] *Michael Kraus*, Numerical methods group, Max-Planck Institute for Plasma Physics.
- **An introduction to B-Splines**: [to determine] *Deepesh Toshniwal*, DIAM, TUDelft.

## What are the expected outputs of the SIG?

### Open discussion sessions

- Promote internal transfer of knowledge.
- Promote the discussion and interaction within the center for applied math and numerical analysis topics.

### Talk sessions

- Increased expertise within the center for applied math and numerical analysis.
- Increased visibility of the center within the applied math and numerical analysis community.
- Knowledge transfer from external participants to the center.
